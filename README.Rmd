# New Zealand Spatial Features <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height=140/>

New Zealand Spatial Features (`nzsf`) is a package for creating scientific maps in New Zealand waters. The `nzsf` package relies heavily on the R packages `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `sf` providing a fresh and easy approach for complex mapping tasks. Maps can be built up in layers in the same way as `ggplot2` so users can easily add points, lines/arrows, polygons, coastlines, and much more. 

## Installation

The `nzsf` package can be installed from within R using:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
install_github(repo = "quantifish/nzsf", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

In the future I hope to release `nzsf` as a formal R package on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

## Help

The package vignettes are a great place to see what `nzsf` can do. You can view the package vignettes from within R using:

``` r
browseVignettes(package = "nzsf")
vignette(topic = "nzsf", package = "nzsf")
```

Alternatively, you can look at the help pages associated with each function and data set in `nzsf`. To see them all use:

``` r
help(package = "nzsf")
```

## Shapefiles

The `nzsf` package includes many different shapefiles including New Zealand Quota Management Area (QMA) boundaries for many finfish and shellfish stocks including:

Other useful shapefiles include:

* The New Zealand coastline (in high, medium, and low resolution)
* Depth contours (in high, medium, and low resolution)
* New Zealands Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
* Department of Conservation (DOC) marine reserves
* Rock lobster statistical areas
* New Zealand rocky reefs
* Te Tapuwae o Rongokako (Gisborne) habitats and reefs

These shapefiles can be accessed using the `data` command in R. For example:

``` r
data("doc_marine_reserves")
```

If you would like additional shapefiles added just let me know in the issues (please include a link to the shapefiles).
